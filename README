This repository is intended for source **development**

A stable versions of the auteur package is available from http://cran.r-project.org/.  In the R console, the command 
	install.packages("auteur", type="source")
will locally compile the package.  If this fails, try 
	install.packages("auteur") 
which will install a pre-compiled version. Contact <jonathan.eastman@gmail.com> if difficulties persist. 

Development versions of the package will be maintained at gitHUB (https://github.com/eastman/auteur), yet note that trusted versions of the package will be posted to CRAN.
