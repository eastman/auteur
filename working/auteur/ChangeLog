CHANGES IN AUTEUR VERSION 0.11

2011-02-16
 * modified bm.lik.fn() to use sparse matrix format and inverting of Hadfield and Nakagawa 2010
 * this modification to bm.lik.fn() yields a computational advantage, noticeable for very large phylogenies

2011-02-08
  * rewrote vmat() to play with the new API in Rcpp_0.9.0
  * using STL containers in vmat() rather than those provided by Rcpp

2011-01-19
  * works (only) with Rcpp_0.8.6
  * updated shifts.plot()
  * now accommodates measurement error associated with trait values

2011-01-18
  * added a utility for ultrametricizing trees naively (where root to tip lengths are very close but not identical; see ultrametricize())
  * modified tracer() to allow user-specification of plotting axes in log-likelihood traces
  * changed package name from rjmcmc.traits to 'auteur' (Accommodating Uncertainty in Trait Evolution Using rjMCMC)

2011-01-16
  * converted sortedges to a C++ function (see vmat.cpp)

2011-01-13
  * variance-covariance calculation now performed using C++: see vmat.R()

2011-01-09 
  * now storing memory intensive results as (compressed) .rda files
  * splitormerge(): had treated a global rate as K=1; now assuming that a global rate is not equivalent to a single local rate; now K = 0 for a global-rate model (Drummond and Suchard 2010)

2011-01-07  
  * created package
