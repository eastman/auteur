CHANGES IN AUTEUR VERSION 0.11
2011-05-04
  * updated mcmc.levy to involve appropriate proposal distributions
  * changed jumpsize to prop.width in rjmcmc functions to prevent confusion with jumps in mcmc.levy 

2011-04-15
  * added support for Levy process (jump-Brownian) evolution
	- mcmc.levy (hidden Markov MCMC algorithm)
	- updateJvcv (VCV matrix of jumps)
	- updateLvcv (VCV matrix needed for the multivariate normal model)
	- adjustjump (table of jumps)
  * added simulator for the jump-Brownian process
	- phenogram
	- levyevolver
  * added several accessory function from LJ Revell
	- propose.loc
	- tree.step
	- random.node
	- match.all

2011-02-28
  * updated get.descendants.of.node(), adapting code from GEIGER for optimization
  * cleaned up compilation warnings for ouweights.cpp and vmat.cpp concerning comparisons between signed and unsigned integers (due to std::vector::size)

2011-02-23
  * added Ornstein-Uhlenbeck as an alternative model of trait evolution
  * files added are as follows
	- src: oumat.cpp and ouweights.cpp
	- R: get.epochs.R, get.times.R, ou.lik.fn.R, oumat.R, ouweights.R, rjmcmc.ou.R, assignroottheta.R, ultrametrize.R, fit.hansen.R
  * deprecated generate.log() and determine.accepted.proposal()
  * modified parlogger() to be far more memory efficient and to allow output to be read by Tracer (Drummond 2007)
  * modified cleanup.files() to deal with new output from parlogger()
  * modified summarize.run()
  * modified tracer()
  * modified pool.rjmcmcsamples()
  * merged several files by function
  * revised choose.one() to select edges by branch length
  * revised calibrate.jumpsize to invoke spline() in jumpsize determination

2011-02-08
  * rewrote vmat() to play with the new API in Rcpp_0.9.0
  * using STL containers in vmat() rather than those provided by Rcpp

2011-01-19
  * works (only) with Rcpp_0.8.6
  * updated shifts.plot()
  * now accommodates measurement error associated with trait values

2011-01-18
  * added a utility for ultrametricizing trees naively (where root to tip lengths are very close but not identical; see ultrametricize())
  * modified tracer() to allow user-specification of plotting axes in log-likelihood traces
  * changed package name from rjmcmc.traits to 'auteur' (Accommodating Uncertainty in Trait Evolution Using R)

2011-01-16
  * converted sortedges to a C++ function (see vmat.cpp)

2011-01-13
  * variance-covariance calculation now performed using C++: see vmat.R()

2011-01-09 
  * now storing memory intensive results as (compressed) .rda files
  * splitormerge(): had treated a global rate as K=1; now assuming that a global rate is not equivalent to a single local rate; now K = 0 for a global-rate model (Drummond and Suchard 2010)

2011-01-07  
  * created package
